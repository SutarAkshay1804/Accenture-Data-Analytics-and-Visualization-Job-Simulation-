Dear Social Buzz client holders, 

I am pleased to present to you the key insights, which provides a detaile overview of our recent data analytics project for Social Buzz. As a data analyst, 
I would like to explain the key findings and recommendations from the project.

The project's main objective was to identify Social Buzz's top five most popular categories of content from over 100,000 daily pieces of content, 
including text, images, videos, and GIFs. 

Our team, led by Andrew Fleming and Marcus Rompton, undertook various processes such as data understanding, cleansing, modeling, and 
analysis to derive meaningful insights from the raw data.

Our analysis revealed that animals are the most popular category, and photos are the preferred content type. We recommend focusing on GIFs and audio to 
enhance their usage. The presentation also includes a summary of the findings, the analytics team involved, and the analytical process.

We hope that this presentation provides valuable insights into Social Buzz's content strategy and helps you make informed decisions.
 Please let us know if you have any questions or require further information.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
